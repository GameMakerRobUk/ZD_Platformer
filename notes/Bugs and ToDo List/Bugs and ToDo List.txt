!!! Bugs !!!

- Moving vertically along the bottom of a slope moves you at double speed
- Need some smaller jumps for the smaller platforms
* Action button for ladders appears when it shouldnt (eg if you are behind a block
  that the ladder is in front of)


!!! Planned Features !!!

- Silhouette of player when obscured by obstacles
- Limit player movement when moving horizontally on ladders.
  EG bbox_left of player should not exceed bbox_left of ladder. If touching multiple ladders, 
  the closest bbox should be used (eg should not exceed any bbox even fractionally)
- Player Shadow improvement - let's have the ability to draw partial shadows where they should
  be, eg split between different platforms
